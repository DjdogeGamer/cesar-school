## About CESAR School
CESAR School is first and foremost an innovation school. Trains innovative professionals, able to foster and execute projects that bring relevant changes to society. The training is focused on the interests of the market, both from a technical point of view, as well as skills such as protagonism, leadership, teamwork and self-entrepreneurship. To achieve this goal, CESAR School makes use of the PBL - Problem-Based Learning method of teaching. From real market problems there is the learning of concepts, theories and practices and the development of skills and attitudes. 

CESAR School has a great difference compared to other educational institutions: CESAR is part of Porto Digital, one of Brazil's main technology parks and innovation environments, with more than 200 companies, and is connected to hundreds of other entities in Worldwide.
